<p>Around campus I've been seeing a lot of Facebook t-shirts that say simply
"Code, Ship, Repeat". That got me thinking: do companies actually
mean to prescripe this recipe to employees and use it as a branding tool? 
Nowhere in the Caesarian terseness of that mantra is there a reference to
testing, validation, refactoring, or even making sure that the code you write is
going to be used by anybody. 
<br>
<p>It's neat to have a three-word slogan, but slogans can have an enormous impact on 
how people see their work. Imagine a civil engineer wearing a t-shirt that said
"Draw, Build, Repeat". I wouldn't trust that engineer with a sizeable project. 
Programming is no different except the stakes of failure are more chronic and
less dramatic. Instead of buildings collapsing, poor software engineering leads
to wasted weeks. Not as news-worthy, sure. But tragic nonetheless.
<br>
<p>I believe ideologies towards programming like "Code, Ship, Repeat" are
dangerous and inevitably lead to cancerous code growth. So instead, I propose a
new slogan for mid-life companies no longer focused on producing a MVP:
"Refactor, Delete, Repeat". 
<br>
<p>Because a product that isn't minimal isn't viable for long.
