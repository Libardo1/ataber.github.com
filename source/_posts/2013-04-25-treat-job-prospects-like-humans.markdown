<p>I've been applying to a lot of jobs lately, and I've noticed that a
surprising number of shops, even startups, do not treat me like a human. One
place (a small startup with no HR department) even sent me an email a month and
a half after I'd applied with instructions about how to sign up for some service
they use to screen job applicants. Not even a "thank you for applying", not even
a personalized email. Not even on time (I've accepted another offer already) and
not even with a reference to the original company I was applying to (only by
googling the person who sent the email did I find out what company they were
from).</p>
<p>And you complain about not being able to find talent?</p>
<p>I call bullshit.</p>
<p>I answered a job post on HackerNews and I got a canned response that was
faulty in every way. And you expect me to believe you're going to treat your
customers, investors, and employees any better?</p>
<p>Or how about another company which posts jobs to HackerNews just about every
week with a puzzle in it that is completely incomprehensible and must be solved
<strong>TO EVEN EMAIL THEM</strong>? Obviously all your employees are automatons, because
presumably you're treating me like you treat them.</p>
<p>The digital age has been dramatically labor-reducing in a lot of ways. But
so many people don't leverage the technology we have today <strong>to make
interactions more, rather than less, personal</strong>. AirBnB does this, why can't
everyone?</p>
