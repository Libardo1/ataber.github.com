<p>The other day I decided to walk away from a weightlifting session after having only done two sets. I hadn't made progress in days and every session I seemed to get weaker. So I quit. Only temporarily, but I needed it badly.</p>
<br />
<p>After days of not making substantial progress on an endeavor that is central to my ego-health, I have a tendency to lean in to the frustration. My capacity for focus and my determination curdle in the white-hot frustration and my effort turns into an engine producing nothing of value, only more frustration.</p>
<br />
<p>So I've tried a new tactic: diversify my ego investments to prevent this from happening, and if it still happens, remember that the body and mind work best when loaded with a sinusoidal pressure, and prepare for that slump of downtime we all need once in a while.</p>
