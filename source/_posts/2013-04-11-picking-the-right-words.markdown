<p>In mathematics, the units of technology are words. Progress is measured in
terms of the elegance with which complex ideas can be represented. And this is
dependent on the quality of words we choose to represent our ideas. </p>
<p>That's why I enjoy mathematics: the central struggle is to reframe complex
problems in ways where it is trivial to imagine a solution. The goal of any
research program is to find just the right linguistic prism (or sieve) to seperate the
muddled reality of a problem into its constituent components.</p>
<p>In programming, I often find that "seperating things that change from things
that stay the same" is a common refrain, and it rhymes with the one
mathematicians have been preaching for some time. Let's just be more
straightforward about it: like math, the goal of computer science is to find the right words to
express yourself.</p>
<p>I like this perspective because it constrains programmers to realize that
everything from data structures to frameworks like Rails exist because they are
in some way "the right words" for a given situation. These may not be the
fastest ways of solving the problem, but sometimes the benefit of clear
expression is worth the sacrifice.</p>
