			Picking the Right Words</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In mathematics, the units of technology are words. Progress is measured in
terms of the elegance with which complex ideas can be represented. And this is
dependent on the quality of words we choose to represent our ideas. </p>


<p>That&#8217;s why I enjoy mathematics: the central struggle is to reframe complex
problems in ways where it is trivial to imagine a solution. The goal of any
research program is to find just the right linguistic prism (or sieve) to seperate the
muddled reality of a problem into its constituent components.</p>


<p>In programming, I often find that &#8220;seperating things that change from things
that stay the same&#8221; is a common refrain, and it rhymes with the one
mathematicians have been preaching for some time. Let&#8217;s just be more
straightforward about it: like math, the goal of computer science is to find the right words to
express yourself.</p>


<p>I like this perspective because it constrains programmers to realize that
everything from data structures to frameworks like Rails exist because they are
in some way &#8220;the right words&#8221; for a given situation. These may not be the
fastest ways of solving the problem, but sometimes the benefit of clear
expression is worth the sacrifice.</p>

			The Code, Ship, Repeat Fallacy</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Around campus I&#8217;ve been seeing a lot of Palantir t-shirts that say simply
&#8220;Code, Ship, Repeat&#8221;. That got me thinking: do companies actually
mean to prescripe this recipe to employees and use it as a branding tool? 
Nowhere in the Caesarian terseness of that mantra is there a reference to
testing, validation, refactoring, or even making sure that the code you write is
going to be used by anybody. 
<br>
<p>It&#8217;s neat to have a three-word slogan, but slogans can have an enormous impact on 
how people see their work. Imagine a civil engineer wearing a t-shirt that said
&#8220;Draw, Build, Repeat&#8221;. I wouldn&#8217;t trust that engineer with a sizeable project. 
Programming is no different except the stakes of failure are more chronic and
less dramatic. Instead of buildings collapsing, poor software engineering leads
to wasted weeks. Not as news-worthy, sure. But tragic nonetheless.
<br>
<p>I believe ideologies towards programming like &#8220;Code, Ship, Repeat&#8221; are
dangerous and inevitably lead to cancerous code growth. So instead, I propose a
new slogan for mid-life companies no longer focused on producing a MVP:
&#8220;Refactor, Delete, Repeat&#8221;. 
<br>
<p>Because a product that isn&#8217;t minimal isn&#8217;t viable for long.

			Autonomy of the Avatar</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s often said that anonymity is the distinguishing, delightful, and dangerous property of the internet. 
Anonymity is blamed as the factor causing internet trolls and low-quality
discourse online, but I believe the more harmful phenonenon the internet creates
opportunity for is something I call autonomous avatars. 
<br>
<p>With Facebook, Twitter or Reddit, it becomes possible within minutes to forge a 
new personality. In fact, not only is it possible, but practically omnipresent: how
many people do you know who selectively post to Facebook in order to create a more
aesthetically pleasing version of themselves?
<br>
<p>These avatars we create for ourselves are becoming a source of motivation: 
pictures are taken for the sole purpose of posting to Facebook, for example.
These avatars in a sense become autonomous. The identities we craft online 
affect how we behave in a bizarre feedback loop.
<br>
<p>But this doesn&#8217;t qualify as dangerous yet. What I believe makes the autonomous
avatar more dangerous than anonymity is the fact that in a truly anonymous situation,
repercussions of actions are nonexistent. This precludes positive social reinforcement as
much as punishment. Without social reinforcement, the group is less likely to become
a torch-carrying mob. However, when we introduce artificial identities, it is more likely
that cognitive dissonance motivates behavior that would otherwise be unthinkable.
<br>
<p>I believe this is why bullying on Facebook is much more dangerous than that on 4chan.
The bullys on Facebook have a facade to hold up, and this pushes antisocial behavior to a whole other level.
