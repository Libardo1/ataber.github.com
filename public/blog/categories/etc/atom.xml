    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's often said that anonymity is the distinguishing, delightful, and dangerous property of the internet. 
Anonymity is blamed as the factor causing internet trolls and low-quality
discourse online, but I believe the more harmful phenonenon the internet creates
opportunity for is something I call autonomous avatars. 
<br>
<p>With Facebook, Twitter or Reddit, it becomes possible within minutes to forge a 
new personality. In fact, not only is it possible, but practically omnipresent: how
many people do you know who selectively post to Facebook in order to create a more
aesthetically pleasing version of themselves?
<br>
<p>These avatars we create for ourselves are becoming a source of motivation: 
pictures are taken for the sole purpose of posting to Facebook, for example.
These avatars in a sense become autonomous. The identities we craft online 
affect how we behave in a bizarre feedback loop.
<br>
<p>But this doesn't qualify as dangerous yet. What I believe makes the autonomous
avatar more dangerous than anonymity is the fact that in a truly anonymous situation,
repercussions of actions are nonexistent. This precludes positive social reinforcement as
much as punishment. Without social reinforcement, the group is less likely to become
a torch-carrying mob. However, when we introduce artificial identities, it is more likely
that cognitive dissonance motivates behavior that would otherwise be unthinkable.
<br>
<p>I believe this is why bullying on Facebook is much more dangerous than that on 4chan.
The bullys on Facebook have a facade to hold up, and this pushes antisocial behavior to a whole other level.
